  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <div className="bio-grid">
    <div className="bio-text">
      <p>I was born in Cuba and moved to the Florida Keys when I was four years old. I grew up in Key Largo, where the vibrant local ecosystem sparked my deep appreciation for nature and animals. From a young age, Iâ€™ve also had a strong interest in art, whether it was drawing, painting, or even clay sculpting during high school.
      </p>
      <p>In my sophomore year, I joined the weightlifting team, which introduced me to fitness and inspired a lasting passion for health and strength. Iâ€™m currently attending the University of Central Florida. I originally started as an electrical engineering major, but after discovering computer science and the endless creative ways it allows you to solve problems, I made the switch.
      </p>
      <p>I'm also pursuing a minor in robotics to stay connected with my engineering interests and to explore the synergy between hardware and software. I'm excited about the future and look forward to using both the experiences Iâ€™ve gained and the ones to come to grow personally and professionally.
